Bits and Subs wil be highlighted further. The names scale nice and dynamically. This game is standalone and does not require any additional accounts or authentication besides Twitch. You authenticate to twitch using Oauth for a safe and simple login experience. After logging in for the first time, your credentials are encrypted and automatically remembered. There are also no applications or websites (beside your stream) your chatters need to use; they just type moves they like to see right in twitch chat. At the end of the turn the votes get tallied and the move with the most votes gets played. Of course the timer can be paused to give your slow chatters a bit more time. You can also choose to play without a timer and force turns to end whenever you please. During the games your chatters accumulate points by participating. After the game a highscore displaying the points will show the top participants. A highscore of the game itself and a historical highscore is available!

       "83642  Chess Vs Chat allows streamers to host chess matches where your chatters actively participate and engage with the match via your twitch stream simply by typing the moves they would like to play right in the chat. :) You can play against your chat, or let chat brawl among themselfs. While there are more apps that do just that; Chess vs Chat tries to step up the game by having more features that expand and smooth the experience. The streamer sets the timers; presses play on the game mode they like and the match is going. Chatters get sorted in teams with their names, emotes and votes wil be shown in the game window. Bits and Subs wil be highlighted further. The names scale nice and dynamically. This game is standalone and does not require any additional accounts or authentication besides Twitch. You authenticate to twitch using Oauth for a safe and simple login experience. After logging in for the first time, your credentials are encrypted and automatically remembered. There are also no applications or websites (beside your stream) your chatters need to use; they just type moves they like to see right in twitch chat. At the end of the turn the votes get tallied and the move with the most votes gets played. Of course the timer can be paused to give your slow chatters a bit more time. You can also choose to play without a timer and force turns to end whenever you please. During the games your chatters accumulate points by participating. After the game a highscore displaying the points will show the top participants. A highscore of the game itself and a historical highscore is available! (The user database created for this information is stored as a text file right on your computer, so no external sources. ;) ) You can play a regular game from the start or you can choose to play from a set position by loading FEN code’s from your clipboard right into the game. This way you play from a fixed starting position or even try to load chess puzzles to play with chat! Not on...   \n",
