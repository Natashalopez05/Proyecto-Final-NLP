It’s more of a slow burn than other match-3 games, requiring cold, calculated actions on behalf of the player. That threw me off at first, but – flawed though it is – I found myself having a lot of fun with it.” Gamezebo “There seems to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like puzzle games. It’s like developers are deconstructing what a game is, reinventing what has traditionally been a very challenge-driven, competitive, high-pressure medium. Within that context, But to Paint a Universe succeeds admirably, and casual gamers could certainly do worse than pick it up” Indie Game Reviewer</td>\n",

       "8      The only aim in Rust is to survive. Everything wants you to die - the island’s wildlife and other inhabitants, the environment, other survivors. Do whatever it takes to last another night. Rust is in its 10th year and has now had over 375 content updates, with a guaranteed content patch every month. From regular balance fixes and improvements to AI and graphics updates to adding content like new maps, musical instruments, trains and drones, as well as regular seasons and events, there’s always something interesting or dangerous (or both) happening on the island. Updates to the game include: Procedurally generated worlds with map editor support Host your own servers and with server-side modding support Vehicles: horses, modular cars, hot air balloons, helicopters, trains, boats and more Complex electrical and automation systems Farming New enemies, wildlife and factions New monuments and areas to explore Gestures and contact system Musical instruments Large train network Huge recent graphics overhaul ..and more EXPLORE You wake naked on a mysterious island armed only with a rock and a torch. You’ll need to brave natural dangers (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), scavenge materials. Explore the island, its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors... BUILD Design and build bases to defend your territory or control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, commandeer vehicles from horses to cars to boats to helicopters. Whatever it takes to get ahead. SURVIVE There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armor and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends and allies and build a town together. Explore the island and what’s happening in it. Trade with other players. Or prey on them, raiding their bases and taking their hard-won goods. For parental controls,...   \n",

The experience is designed to allow children and their families to feel more comfortable with the treatments they are about to receive, we do this by taking them through the experience virtually. Requires another person to supervise and respond to keyboard prompts. Photogrammetry (photo – realistic) procedure rooms Using a team of game developers and cinematographers re-created a CT procedure room. Guided walk through of procedures. We worked with direct access and feedback from hospitals, clinicians and play therapists to create a guided walk through of the CT procedure. Friendly Characters Robot hospital staff to walk the children through the experience. Environmental Interactivity Interact with the rooms and discover how the machines sound and how they work in a safe 'non scary' environment. Exposure Therapy The rooms are currently being user tested as a method of Exposure therapy, desensitising people to the procedures and rooms and as a result lowering the amount of children needing sedation for these non evasive procedures.   \n",

But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides.

We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: it’s all free.

That threw me off at first, but – flawed though it is – I found myself having a lot of fun with it.” Gamezebo “There seems to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like puzzle games. It’s like developers are deconstructing what a game is, reinventing what has traditionally been a very challenge-driven, competitive, high-pressure medium. Within that context, But to Paint a Universe succeeds admirably, and casual gamers could certainly do worse than pick it up” Indie Game Reviewer    \n",
